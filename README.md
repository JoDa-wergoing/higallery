HiGallery

HiGallery lets you display your STRATO HiDrive photo folders directly on your WordPress site as structured photo albums.

Unlike traditional gallery plugins, HiGallery does not import images into the WordPress Media Library. 
Images stay in HiDrive and are delivered securely to your site, which is ideal for large collections or photo archives that are managed outside WordPress.

HiGallery focuses on simplicity, performance, and security, following WordPress.org best practices.
